        <p> <strong>The Dangers That Prevail In Investment Scams </strong> <br> <br>
            Investment scams are not a new phenomenon. They had existed since the 1800s when the US Government
            tried to regulate them. However, they became more widespread in the 1930s during the Great Depression,
            and then after that, they never really died out. The first documented case of a Ponzi scheme was in 1920.
            Charles Ponzi found success in this fraudulent practice by promising investors 50% profit in 90 days, which was unheard of. Investors would give him their investment, and he would pay them back with the money collected from other investors. After a few months, Ponzi brought in $250,000 per day, and people were falling for his scam. 
            
            One of the growing and popular industries today is the investment sector in the financial aspect
            of any country’s economy. The idea of investments dates back to the 18th century in the Dutch Republic.
            It was during this era that we made the first recorded financial investment. Over the years, this has taken a great shape, with investment becoming another source of income for individuals, organizations, and even countries. As expected with every positive opportunity, there are always pitfalls established by unscrupulous individuals or organizations to extort money from unaware victims who fall into their schemes. The purpose of investment is to put an amount of money to use and eventually reap some profit from this venture. This article will look at what investment scams are, the types currently being used, and how to avoid this pitfall.
            
            If you are a victim of an investment scam, you probably feel ashamed, helpless, and devastated.
            Know that this can and has happened to the best of us. What happened to you was a violation of your trust,
            and we understand just how you feel and what to help.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>Cryptocurrency-Related Scams</strong> <br> <br>
            Cryptocurrency-related investment scams are popular scams making waves in the investment industry,
            with the Federal Trades Commission (FTC) receiving complaints and reports now and then. Certain cryptocurrency investments are very credible with well-proven results. Still, others try to take advantage of this relatively new industry. Many people have reported losing their life savings through this investment scam.   The nature of this investment scam makes it difficult for authorities to be on top of matters, thereby giving opportunity for these scammers to flee the arm of justice. Before investing, know that you are being exposed to a lot of risk with little or no benefits.
            
            Cryptocurrency scammers are at it again. They will use any trick in the book to dupe you out of
            your money and leave you with nothing more than a few broken dreams. Cryptocurrency-related scams work like this: they act as a group, also known as “pump and dump”.They create a fake token and make sure to spread the rumor that it will soon be worth more than its price. This increases the demand for the token and deceives investors into buying it, which in turn skyrockets its price. The scammer then makes a sale order before the price falls again because of oversupply on the market. In addition to creating fake tokens, those who are into Cryptocurrency related scams are also using social media ads to convince potential victims of their legitimacy. The best way for us to avoid these scams is by being informed about them beforehand: research and read about them extensively before investing or giving out information or money.

            Binary options are a gamble. You either win or lose. That is why they are called binary options because there is no other settlement possible. It has become an increasingly popular financial instrument because of its simplicity. It allows traders/investors to gamble on whether an asset’s price will go up or down in the future. With this investment, you know what you stand to gain before trading. The binary options fraudsters will actually play with the prices, offer you lucrative bonuses, and manipulate the software to lure you into investing more money. Most of the illegal and unregulated binary options brokers will just disappear to their clients.

        <strong>Forex Scam</strong> <br>
        Forex scams are all the rage these days, especially among the people who are just finding out about this form of trading. However, you should know that Forex trading is not a scam. The market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, and offers much more liquidity than traditional markets. Forex Scam is also called Fake Forex Brokers.
         It’s scariest because scams are not limited to binary options trading like other forms of investment. Scammers create fake forex companies and lure their victims into believing they’re legitimate so they can steal their money when they deposit to start trading after knowing the victim has lots of funds in their account and then suddenly stop answering the phone.
         Forex scams are not just a single group of traders, and there are many ways they can be deployed.
         <img src="trading-forex-trade-stock.jpg" alt=""> <br><br>
        There are many Forex scam types, and some of them are shown in the following list: <p></p> <br><br>
<ol>
    <li>Fake Trading Accounts</li>
    <li>Fake Brokers</li>
    <li>Stock Scams</li>
    <li>Unregulated Brokers (possible scams)</li>
</ol> <br><br>
    <p>
    We have all come across this investment scam that offers the opportunity to use your money in investing in foreign currencies. These investments promise the hopes of gaining returns on the changes in the rates of certain currencies. Unfortunately, this type of investment scam comes with high risk, leading you to lose all your money. Forex scams work by these individuals or organizations going after their victims through advertisement and any other means. They then invite their soon-to-be victim to a seminar to explain the whole process; the victim would not be given the full details of the operations. People who express interest in this scam are then influenced by using high-pressure sales techniques to join the business. The victim is given documents with no legal backing to sign. They are then asked to send the money to a foreign account to be managed by so-called experts,
    who then either disappear with the money or make poor investment decisions.

        <strong>Protect Yourself From an Investment Scam!</strong> 
        We’re going to discuss the most common tips for different types of investment scams.
        So if you’ve been thinking about investing in any financial products, this will help you protect yourself against being fooled by scammers.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Be aware</strong>
        The first step is to be aware that scams exist. This will help you spot them better,
        especially when they are disguised as legitimate offers. There are some signs you can look out for, such as an urgent request to invest in something, unsolicited calls, emails, or texts with promises of high returns. You should also keep an eye out for investment schemes that sound too good to be true.

        <br><br>
        <strong> Do your research</strong> <br><br>
        Always research the company thoroughly before investing in it and make sure it’s
        legal and regulated by the SEC (Security Exchange Commission). Experts usually recommend conducting thorough research of the company and its product before investing. This way, you can carefully investigate their products, audited financial statements, and other information to verify if they are authentic. A lot of investors also recommend looking at the background of the company’s founders and board members. Keep in mind that if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is, so do not let your guard down and blindly invest in anything!
        <br><br>

        <strong>Be curious</strong> <br><br>
        Fraudsters succeed because most victims do not ask the burning questions and are generally naive.
        So do your independent research, and you will likely find holes in their story. 
        <br><br>

        <strong>Do not be swayed by the grandeur</strong> <br><br>
        Fraudsters love to put on a show, especially in investment scams that deal with vast sums of money.
        They will show ”proof” like their office, testimonials and referrals from past clients, a legit website, etc., all in the bid to convince you of their legitimacy. So before investing, check with the investment agencies in your country to see if the company is who they say they are.
